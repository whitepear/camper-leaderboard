This application is live at: https://whitepear.github.io/projects/react/leaderboard/app/index.html

A responsively-designed React.js application that allows users to view the top 100 'campers' on FreeCodeCamp - a website dedicated to providing free programming education. Users can view the campers with the most all-time points, or view the campers that have accumulated the greatest number of points in the past 30 days.

The application architecture is designed around a stateful container component, within which a stateless functional component resides. The application consumes JSON data from the FreeCodeCamp Camper API in order to generate up-to-date rankings. Styling is implemented via Sass.
